- **Future:** Migrate to DynamoDB for permanent storage

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend (AWS Lambda)
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18
- **Function:** bill-finance-minimal-dev-api
- **Storage:** Global memory with 275+ transactions
- **Parsing:** Custom CSV parsers for AMEX, Truist, and generic formats

### Frontend (React + S3)
- **Framework:** React 18 with Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom cyber theme
- **Charts:** Recharts for data visualization
- **Hosting:** S3 static website hosting

### AWS Resources
- **API Gateway:** REST endpoints with CORS
- **Lambda:** Serverless compute with 30s timeout
- **S3:** Frontend hosting + CSV upload bucket
- **DynamoDB:** Table exists but not currently in use (Lambda memory preferred for speed)

## 📋 Immediate Todo List
